Our Project: Sydney Urban Cooling
We built this together with one goal in mind: to help cool down our city using the wisdom of nature. Sydney Urban Cooling is our way of showing how tree canopy coverage can fight back against the rising heat in urban spaces—and how everyday people can be part of the solution.

What We Made:
Our web app lets you explore Sydney’s urban heat islands and see how planting trees—virtually and in real life—can make a real difference. It is a simulation - based solution as to how plantation can help rejuvanate and revitalise Sydney.

What You Can Do With It
- See the Heat: Explore a live heat map of Sydney’s hottest urban zones
- Simulate Tree Coverage: Add trees to the map and watch the temperature shift
- Plant Interactively: Draw your own tree canopy and test its cooling effect
- Share Readings: Upload your own temperature data to help crowdsource insights
- Check the Weather: Get real-time conditions via OpenWeather
- Use It Anywhere: It works smoothly on both desktop and mobile

Why Trees?
We took inspiration from how forests naturally regulate temperature. Here’s what trees do that we tried to simulate:
- They release water vapor through evapotranspiration, cooling the air
- Their canopies create shade, lowering surface temperatures
- They redirect wind, improving airflow in dense urban areas
- They absorb carbon, helping fight climate change
We wanted to bring those benefits into the city—digitally first, then physically.

How We Built It
We kept things lightweight and accessible:
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- Maps: Leaflet.js for the interactive heat map
- Weather: OpenWeather API for live data
- Storage: Browser localStorage to save community readings
- Hosting: Static site—no backend needed

Why It Matters
Urban heat islands can push city temperatures up by as much as 12°C compared to nearby rural areas. By increasing tree coverage, we can:
- Cool hotspots by 1–5°C
- Cut energy use for air conditioning by up to 30%
- Improve air quality and reduce health risks
- Make cities more livable and resilient
