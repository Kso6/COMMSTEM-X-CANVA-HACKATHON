# Sydney Urban Cooling

A nature-inspired solution to combat urban heat islands in Sydney through tree canopy simulation and community engagement.

## 🌿 About

Sydney Urban Cooling is a web application that visualizes urban heat islands in Sydney and demonstrates how increasing tree canopy coverage can help mitigate these effects. The project was created for the 2025 Comm-Stem Hackathon with the theme "Hack with Nature, Build for Tomorrow."

## 🔥 Features

- **Heat Map Visualization**: View Sydney's urban heat island hotspots
- **Tree Canopy Simulation**: Visualize the cooling impact of increased tree coverage
- **Interactive Tree Planting**: Draw trees directly on the map to see their effect
- **Community Readings**: Add your own temperature readings to crowdsource data
- **Real-time Weather**: Integration with OpenWeather API to show current conditions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🌱 Inspiration from Nature

This project is inspired by the natural cooling mechanisms of forest canopies:

1. **Evapotranspiration**: Trees release water vapor, cooling the surrounding air
2. **Shade Creation**: Tree canopies block direct sunlight, reducing surface temperatures
3. **Wind Modification**: Trees alter air movement patterns, improving urban ventilation
4. **Carbon Sequestration**: Trees absorb CO₂, helping mitigate climate change

## 🛠️ Technology

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- **Weather Data**: OpenWeather API for current conditions and forecasts
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for community readings
- **Deployment**: Static site, no backend required

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the heat map and try the different features
4. Add your own temperature readings

## 📊 Impact

Urban heat islands can increase temperatures by up to 12°C in cities compared to surrounding areas. By strategically increasing tree canopy coverage, we can:

- Reduce temperatures by 1-5°C in urban hotspots
- Lower energy consumption for cooling by up to 30%
- Improve air quality and public health
- Create more livable urban spaces
